[] bricks coord off the actual positions.  The origin (of the copy original) should be the first brick position?
[] test-init bike location
[] BIKE/BRICK z position strange-due to child of.  only parent actually moves.  to_world matrix did not work.  probably this is not being updated per frame. bike16.location + (0, -1 * y_offset, 0) should be used to calculate distance.
